#  Installation process and requirements

== Installing the Command-Line Assistant Powered by RHEL Lightspeed

To install the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have the following:

1. A subscribed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system. For more information on system registration, refer to the [Getting Started with RHEL System Registration](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/getting_started_with_the_rhel_8_web_console/index) documentation.
2. Root access to your system.

**Installation Procedure**

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install the command-line assistant using the official RHEL repositories:

   ```
   sudo dnf install command-line-assistant
   ```

   **Note:** Do not use the `pip install command-line-assistant` command, as Red Hat does not support this installation option.

3. Verify the installation by running the command-line assistant. For example:

   ```
   c "How to install python?"
   ```

   You should see a response from the assistant, confirming that it is correctly installed and functioning.

**Database Configuration**

The command-line assistant stores its data in a database. You can choose between MySQL or PostgreSQL. Here's how to configure either:

1. Access your database configuration file at `/etc/xdg/command-line-assistant/config.toml`.
2. Locate and comment out the default SQLite configuration.
3. Configure the database of your choice by setting the type and details. For MySQL, for instance, it would look like this:

   ```
   [database]
   type = "mysql"
   host = "<hostname_or_ip_address>"
   port = "3306"
   ```

   Replace `<hostname_or_ip_address>` with your database server's address.

4. Save and close the file. The command-line assistant will automatically pick up the new configuration.

By following these steps, you will have successfully installed the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed on your RHEL system.
