#  Provisioning the Command-Line Assistant to RHEL Deployments with Red Hat Satellite

Provisioning the Command-Line Assistant to RHEL Deployments with Red Hat Satellite involves integrating the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed with Red Hat Satellite for system provisioning. This process allows managing command-line assistants across multiple RHEL deployments. Key steps include ensuring the system is registered with Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, having the Satellite Server connected to the internet, and enabling the AppStream repository on the host. The command-line assistant is then installed using the 'sudo dnf install command-line-assistant' command. The configuration file '/etc/xdg/command-line-assistant/config.toml' is edited to point the endpoint to the Satellite or Capsule hostname. Finally, the changes are activated by restarting the command-line assistant daemon (clad) with 'sudo systemctl restart clad'.
